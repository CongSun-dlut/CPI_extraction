DDI-MedLine.d211.s2.p0	The preclinical combination of @DRUG$ with the mTOR inhibitor @DRUG$ has displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM.	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d213.s0.p0	In vivo CYP3A activity is significantly lower in @DRUG$-treated as compared with @DRUG$-treated renal allograft recipients.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d213.s1.p0	In vitro studies have identified @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ as CYP3A inhibitors.	DDI-false

DDI-MedLine.d214.s5.p0	Acute administration of @DRUG$ or @DRUG$ failed to influence locomotion in mice, while their combination normalized motor activity.	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d216.s5.p0	In the @DRUG$ and @DRUG$ phases, the areas under the effect-time curves (self-reported drowsiness and performance) were significantly higher than those in the placebo phase (P < 0.05).	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d216.s6.p0	The findings suggest that the dosage of @DRUG$ should be reduced in patients receiving @DRUG$.	DDI-advise
DDI-MedLine.d217.s0.p0	Interaction of @DRUG$ with different @DRUG$ is antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cells.	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d217.s11.p0	These results, if confirmed in-vivo, indicate that @DRUG$ is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with @DRUG$ for other cancers.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d217.s2.p0	This study investigates the ability of @DRUG$ to sensitize cells from different origins to several @DRUG$.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d218.s0.p0	@DRUG$-@DRUG$ interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d218.s3.p0	We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an @DRUG$ increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in @DRUG$ users.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d218.s5.p0	In total, 430,455 @DRUG$ users contributed 407,370 person-years of @DRUG$ use.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d218.s9.p0	Also @DRUG$, which is not believed to interact with @DRUG$, increased the risk of GI bleeding (OR   =   1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.35]).	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d227.s0.p0	@DRUG$ enhances the antinociceptive effect of @DRUG$ in mice.	DDI-effect
DDI-MedLine.d227.s2.p0	The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the psychostimulant drug @DRUG$ has any effect on @DRUG$-induced antinociception and locomotor inhibitor activity in mice in acute application.	DDI-false
DDI-MedLine.d227.s8.p0	At the same time, the locomotor inhibitory effect of @DRUG$ was counteracted by @DRUG$.	DDI-effect
